# kick-taxonomy-aes-159th
Audio dataset of 46 controlled kick drum recordings from 32 microphones, created for the AES paper on kick drum microphone taxonomy. Provides isolated samples for reproducible research, clustering analysis, and educational demonstrations of microphone timbre and substitution.

# Kick Drum Microphone Dataset (AES 159th Convention)

This repository contains an audio dataset of **46 controlled kick drum recordings from 32 microphones**, created for the AES paper:

> *Kick Drum Microphone Taxonomy: Timbral Clustering of Controlled Kick-Out Recordings*  
> Presented at the **AES 159th Convention**, Long Beach, 2025.

## Dataset description
- Source: single acoustic kick drum recorded under **controlled studio conditions**  
- Consistency: same drum kit, tuning, beater, performer, preamp, and ADC  
- Recording position: identical placement for each microphone (kick-out, centred on port)  
- Format: 44.1 kHz, 24-bit WAV files  
- Each microphone has **4 isolated strikes**, normalised to **-23 LUFS**  
- Total size: ~27.9 MB  

See the AES paper for full methodological details.

## Usage
This dataset is free to use for **research, teaching, and non-commercial projects**.  
Please cite the paper and dataset if you use these recordings in publications or derived works.
